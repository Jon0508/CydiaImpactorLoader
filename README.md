To those who have seen this before, I decided to re-post this version because the change from the initial version was decently massive.

This program is designed to make Cydia Impactor a little easier and allow for you to save your password to make things quicker. Just to be clear. My program is a joke compared to Cydia Impactor and it's not mean as an attack on Saurik or anything like that, just made for lazy people like myself, I respect the work of real programmers like the tweak dev's and Saurik immensely. This is written in Autoit and the source code is available on github.

To run...

1) Download Loaderv2.1withGUI.exe and settingsforloader.ini from https://github.com/nonymoosee/CydiaImpactorLoader/

2) Drop the Loaderv2.1withGUI.exe and settingsforloader.ini in your cydia impactor folder

3) Edit the settingsforloaded.ini file with your login info.

4) Put your IPA's into the Cydia Impactor folder and just launch the program and choose whatever option you want to use, there will be a list of all your IPA's listed in a drop down menu OR drag the whatever .ipa file you want to install onto Loaderv2withGUI.exe, not impactor.exe and it will install that IPA without ever launching the GUI.

Edit: Version 2.1 released and it should be a lot faster/cleaner/less buggy!
