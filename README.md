CydiaImpactorLoader

Hey guys because I sign my own software using Cydia Impactor and having to retype your login over and over every week is annoying, I made this software for everyone (mostly myself) to use. I created a program to autofill everything for you when using cydia impactor, it's programmed in an automation language called autoit and the source code is available on github.
To Run:
1) Download Loaderv2.1withGUI.exe and settingsforloader.ini from https://github.com/nonymoosee/CydiaImpactorLoader/
2) Drop the Loaderv2.1withGUI.exe and settingsforloader.ini in your cydia impactor folder
3) PLACE Cydia Impactor folder on your desktop and RENAME TO "Impactor" (shouldn't be needed any longer)
4) Edit the settingsforloaded.ini file with your login info.
5) Drag the whatever .ipa file you want to install onto 'loader.exe', or just launch and choose IPA from GUI, make sure to place IPA in impactor folder!
6) Watch the magic, hopefully. :)
7) If you want to revoke your certificates, just run the program without dragging an IPA onto it and choose revoke option.

Cydia Impactor Sidenotes unrelated to my program:
1) Make sure impactor is updated because popups from Impactor will break will break the program
2) For cydia impactor to work you need iTunes installed on your computer and your itunes account needs to have 2FA turned off.
Edited for cleanup
